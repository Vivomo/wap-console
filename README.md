# wap-console
A console for mobile browser.

This is a plugin for Front-end. It's can provides a simple console for mobile browsers. like console.log from JS running on the phone.
You can also input something to see the result, like `document.body.width`.
I recommend using it with `browsersync`. Because you can write code with PC's keyboard.  

## How to use it
 

```html
<!-- It's very simple. -->
<script src="src/wapConsole.min.js"></script>
<script >
new WapConsole()
</script>
```
